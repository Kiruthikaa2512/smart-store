## **Section 1: The Business Goal**  
The objective of this project is to **analyze the performance of Endless Aisle fulfillment**, specifically its impact on **customer satisfaction and operational efficiency**.  

ðŸš€ **This project explores how Endless Aisle affects customer satisfaction, return rates, and operational efficiency compared to POS fulfillment.** 

###  
ðŸ“Œ **Understanding Fulfillment Methods in Retail Supply Chain**  
Retail businesses rely on **different fulfillment methods** to ensure efficient product delivery and customer satisfaction. This project focuses on **Endless Aisle**, a fulfillment type where customers can order out-of-stock items via digital systems and have them shipped directly to their homes or a nearby store.  

To compare Endless Aisle's performance, we analyze it alongside **Point of Sale (POS) fulfillment**, where customers buy items in-store or through other traditional retail processes. Some businesses also adopt **Buy Online Pickup In Store (BOPIS)**, allowing customers to order online and pick up products at a physical location.  

ðŸ“Œ **Why Endless Aisle Matters?**  
âœ” **Enhances customer satisfaction** â†’ Avoids out-of-stock frustration.  
âœ” **Improves inventory management** â†’ Enables better demand tracking.  
âœ” **Reduces operational inefficiencies** â†’ Eliminates issues tied to abandoned in-store pickups (seen in BOPIS).   

### **Why This Goal Matters?**  
âœ” **Personal Experience Insight:** Drawing from hands-on knowledge in **Supply Chain Management**, including working on a **FAANG Retail Store project**, this study explores why **Endless Aisle succeeded** where **BOPIS failed** in fulfillment logistics.  
âœ” **Strategic Business Application:** Evaluating **sales, loyalty-based revenue, discount-driven purchase behavior, and operational efficiency metrics** provides actionable insights for retail optimization.  
âœ” **Scaling Opportunities:** Identifying **high-performing regions & reducing fulfillment bottlenecks** can refine Endless Aisle strategies for better **customer retention & satisfaction**.  

## **Section 2: Data Source**  
âœ” **Primary Data:** Retail store transactional records detailing fulfillment types (Endless Aisle vs. Standard).  
âœ” **Customer Data:** Loyalty segmentation, discount usage, repeat purchases.  
âœ” **Sales Metrics:** Monthly revenue, order volume, seasonal purchase trends.  
âœ” **Fulfillment & Logistics Metrics:** Delivery times, return rates, inventory movement.  
âœ” **Source Format:** Extracted from **structured SQL databases and processed via CSV**.  


## **Section 3: Tools Used**  
âœ” **ETL Processing:** SQL for schema refinement, column transformations.  
âœ” **Data Cleaning & Aggregation:** Python (Pandas) for handling missing values.  
âœ” **Visualization:** Power BI for dynamic charts and dashboards.  
âœ” **Analysis Methods:** DAX calculations for return rate estimates, fulfillment trends.  

## **Section 4: Workflow & Logic**  
### **ETL Refinements & Column Modifications**  
âœ” Adjusted **schema for compatibility** with analysis goals.  
âœ” **Inserted synthetic columns in the Sale Table:**  
- **DiscountPercent** â†’ To analyze the effect of discounts on purchase behavior.  
- **FulfillmentType** â†’ To differentiate between Endless Aisle vs. Standard fulfillment.  
- **IsRepeatCustomer** â†’ To measure retention and loyalty trends.  
- **AnomalyFlag** â†’ To flag unusual purchase patterns (like extreme discount usage).  

âœ” **Inserted synthetic columns in the Product Table:**  
- **Brand** â†’ To evaluate product loyalty and brand preferences.  
- **Stock_Quantity** â†’ To identify fulfillment bottlenecks and inventory gaps.  
- **Product_Category** â†’ To categorize products for trend analysis by fulfillment type.  

âœ” **Repopulated the Data Warehouse** to ensure **alignment with project objectives** and meaningful comparisons between fulfillment methods.

### **Data Breakdown & Visual Representation**  
âœ” **Dimension Analysis:**  
- **Fulfillment Type** â†’ Endless Aisle vs. Standard.  
- **Region & Product Category** â†’ Location-based trends.  
- **Customer Loyalty Tier** â†’ Adoption & satisfaction.  
- **Order Month/Season** â†’ Demand spikes.  

âœ” **Numeric Metrics:**  
- **Avg. Delivery Time** â†’ Operational efficiency gauge.  
- **Return Rate** â†’ Success measurement of fulfillment methods.  
- **Order Volume & Avg. Sale Amount** â†’ Customer behavior insight.  
- **Repeat Purchase Rate** â†’ Loyalty-driven retention metric.  

âœ” **Slicing & Dicing Strategy:**  
Grouped by **fulfillment type, region, category, and time segments** to uncover patterns.  

âœ” **Drilldown Insights:**  
Analyzed **high-performing regions/products, return reasons, and loyalty-based purchase behaviors** for deeper strategic insights.  

## **Section 5: Results (Narrative + Visualizations)**  
âœ” **Endless Aisle drives higher repeat purchases**, particularly among Silver-tier customers.  
âœ” **BOPIS failure confirms the importance of smooth fulfillment without requiring in-store pickups.**  
âœ” **Delivery delays correlate directly with increased return rates**, especially in the East region.  
âœ” **Discount-driven purchases show increased returns in Bronze-tier customers but retain Silver-tier buyers.  
âœ” **Bulk preorders via Endless Aisle spike seasonal sales but require refined logistics planning.**
